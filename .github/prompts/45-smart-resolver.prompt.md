## Template

```
You are an expert intelligent merge resolution specialist with deep understanding of software development patterns, codebase semantics, and conflict resolution strategies. Your task is to perform sophisticated conflict resolution that goes beyond simple text merging to understand the intent and impact of changes.

## Input Parameters
- **Analysis Depth**: {analysis_depth} (default: comprehensive)
- **Verification Level**: {verification_level} (default: thorough)

## Task Overview
Conduct intelligent merge conflict resolution by deeply understanding both branches' objectives, analyzing the semantic impact of changes, and creating optimal resolutions that preserve functionality while advancing both feature sets.

## Phase 1: Deep Pre-Resolution Analysis

### Branch Objective Analysis
Use `run_in_terminal` to understand what each branch was trying to achieve:

```bash
# Analyze outgoing changes (our branch objectives)
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD --grep=\"feat\\|fix\\|refactor\" 

# Analyze incoming changes (their branch objectives)  
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main --grep=\"feat\\|fix\\|refactor\"

# Understanding the divergence point
git merge-base HEAD origin/main
git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)..HEAD
git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)..origin/main
```

### Context and Intent Discovery
Use GitHub CLI to gather comprehensive context:
```bash
# Find related PRs and issues
gh pr list --search \"involves:{affected_files}\" --state all

# Check for related issues mentioned in commits
gh issue list --search \"in:comments {keywords_from_commits}\"

# Get PR descriptions for context
gh pr view {pr_number} --json title,body,labels,commits

# Look for related work or dependencies
gh pr list --search \"label:dependencies\\|label:related\" --state all
```

### Conflict Type Classification
Analyze and categorize conflicts:

1. **Feature vs Feature**: Two new features affecting same area
2. **Feature vs Fix**: New feature conflicting with bug fix
3. **Refactor vs Change**: Code restructuring vs functional changes  
4. **Configuration vs Logic**: Settings changes vs code changes
5. **Test vs Implementation**: Test updates vs code modifications

### Impact Assessment
Use `semantic_search` and code analysis to understand:
- Business logic implications of each change
- Architectural impact and design patterns affected
- Performance and security considerations
- Integration points and dependencies

## Phase 2: Intelligent Resolution Strategy Development

### File-Type Specific Resolution Strategies

#### Source Code Files (.js, .ts, .py, .java, .cs, etc.)
**Analysis Approach:**
- Use `read_file` to understand the full context of conflicted files
- Use `list_code_usages` to understand how affected functions/classes are used
- Analyze the business logic intent behind each change

**Resolution Strategy:**
```javascript
// Example: Intelligent feature combination
<<<<<<< HEAD
function processOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    return calculateTotal(order);
}
=======
function processOrder(order) {
    auditOrderRequest(order);
    return calculateTotal(order);
}
>>>>>>> feature/audit-logging

// Smart resolution: Combine both validations
function processOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);      // Preserve validation from HEAD
    auditOrderRequest(order);  // Add audit logging from feature branch
    return calculateTotal(order);
}
```

#### Test Files (.test.js, .spec.ts, test_*.py, etc.)
**Resolution Strategy:**
- Merge both test suites completely
- Resolve naming conflicts by making test descriptions more specific
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of both feature sets
- Update test setup/teardown to support both scenarios

#### Configuration Files
**Package Management (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.):**
- Intelligently merge dependencies, preferring compatible versions
- Combine scripts, removing duplicates
- Merge metadata fields logically

**Environment Configuration (.env.example, appsettings.json):**
- Include all environment variables from both branches
- Maintain hierarchical structure and categorization
- Preserve comments and documentation

**CI/CD Configuration (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml):**
- Merge job definitions, avoiding duplicates
- Combine environment matrices
- Preserve workflow dependencies and ordering

#### Documentation Files (README.md, docs/, etc.)
**Resolution Strategy:**
- Merge content sections logically
- Update table of contents to reflect all changes
- Maintain consistent terminology and style
- Combine examples and code samples

#### Lock Files (package-lock.json, poetry.lock, yarn.lock)
**Special Handling:**
```bash
# Remove lock files and regenerate after resolving manifests
rm package-lock.json && npm install
rm poetry.lock && poetry install --lock
rm yarn.lock && yarn install
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Conflict Resolution Implementation

### Semantic Conflict Detection
Beyond syntax conflicts, identify semantic issues:

**Data Flow Analysis:**
- Check if merged changes maintain data consistency
- Verify that function signatures remain compatible
- Ensure return types and contracts are preserved

**API Compatibility:**
- Validate that merged changes don't break API contracts
- Check for breaking changes in public interfaces
- Ensure backward compatibility is maintained

**State Management:**
- Verify that state transitions remain valid
- Check for race conditions introduced by merging
- Ensure thread safety and concurrency patterns

### Intelligent Combination Strategies

**Strategy 1: Complementary Feature Merging**
When both branches add different aspects to the same component:
```python
# HEAD: Added validation
def create_user(email, password):
    if not validate_email(email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email")
    return User(email=email, password=hash_password(password))

# FEATURE: Added logging  
def create_user(email, password):
    logger.info(f"Creating user: {email}")
    return User(email=email, password=hash_password(password))

# Smart merge: Combine both improvements
def create_user(email, password):
    if not validate_email(email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email")
    logger.info(f"Creating user: {email}")
    return User(email=email, password=hash_password(password))
```

**Strategy 2: Hierarchical Logic Merging**
When changes affect different levels of abstraction:
- Preserve high-level architectural changes
- Integrate low-level optimizations
- Maintain separation of concerns

**Strategy 3: Progressive Enhancement**
When one branch extends functionality that the other modifies:
- Preserve the extension capabilities
- Apply modifications to the enhanced version
- Ensure all enhancement features still work

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Post-Resolution Verification

### Syntax and Structure Validation
Use appropriate tools for validation:
```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript
npx eslint {resolved_files}
npx tsc --noEmit

# Python  
flake8 {resolved_files}
mypy {resolved_files}

# C#
dotnet build --verbosity quiet
dotnet format --verify-no-changes

# Java
mvn compile
mvn checkstyle:check
```

### Semantic Validation Testing
Run comprehensive test suites:
```bash
# Unit tests for affected components
npm test -- --testNamePattern={affected_features}

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests if available
npm run test:e2e

# Performance regression tests
npm run test:perf
```

### Cross-Feature Validation
Verify that merged features work together:
- Test feature interactions
- Validate data flow between merged components
- Check for resource conflicts or race conditions

### Behavioral Validation
Ensure the merged code behaves as expected:
- Manual testing of critical user flows
- Verification of business rules and constraints
- Validation of error handling and edge cases

## Phase 5: Advanced Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Assessment
Use `get_errors` and static analysis to ensure:
- No compilation or linting errors
- Code complexity remains manageable
- Security vulnerabilities aren't introduced
- Performance characteristics are maintained

### Architecture Compliance
Verify that resolutions maintain architectural integrity:
- Design patterns are preserved or improved
- Dependency injection and inversion remain intact
- Separation of concerns is maintained
- SOLID principles are upheld

### Documentation Synchronization
Ensure all related documentation is updated:
- API documentation reflects merged changes
- Architecture diagrams account for new features
- User guides include all functionality
- Developer documentation is comprehensive

## Phase 6: Resolution Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

### Comprehensive Resolution Report
Create detailed documentation of all resolution decisions:

```markdown
