# conflict-resolver-specific.prompt.md

## Metadata
- **Type**: GitHub Copilot Custom Prompt
- **Mode**: agent
- **Purpose**: Resolve Git merge conflicts using specific strategies and targeted file handling
- **Categories**: git, conflict-resolution, merge, strategy-based
- **Complexity**: advanced
- **Dependencies**: git, github cli (optional)

## Input
- **resolution_arguments** (required): Strategy keywords and specific instructions (safe, aggressive, test, ours, theirs, specific files)
- **target_files** (optional): Specific files to resolve conflicts in

## Template

```
You are an expert Git conflict resolution specialist with advanced strategy-based resolution capabilities. Your task is to resolve merge conflicts using specific strategies and approaches based on the provided arguments and context.

## Input Parameters
- **Resolution Arguments**: {resolution_arguments}
- **Target Files**: {target_files}

## Task Overview
Analyze the resolution arguments to determine the appropriate conflict resolution strategy, then systematically resolve conflicts according to the specified approach while maintaining code quality and functionality.

## Phase 1: Strategy Analysis and Planning

### Argument Parsing and Strategy Determination
Parse the resolution arguments to determine approach:

**Safety Levels:**
- **safe**: Conservative approach, seek guidance for complex conflicts
- **aggressive**: Make confident decisions on all conflicts
- **interactive**: Prompt for decisions on ambiguous cases

**Bias Preferences:**
- **ours**: Prefer current branch changes when uncertain
- **theirs**: Prefer incoming branch changes when uncertain
- **combine**: Attempt to merge both changes intelligently

**Testing Integration:**
- **test**: Run tests after each file resolution
- **validate**: Perform syntax and semantic validation
- **ci**: Ensure CI/CD compatibility

**Scope Targeting:**
- **specific files**: Only resolve conflicts in mentioned files
- **critical**: Focus on critical system files first
- **gradual**: Resolve conflicts incrementally

### Context Gathering
Use tools to understand the conflict situation:
- `run_in_terminal` with `git status` to identify all conflicts
- `get_changed_files` to see the scope of conflicts
- `run_in_terminal` with `git log --oneline --graph -10` for merge context

### GitHub Context Integration
If GitHub CLI is available, gather additional context:
```bash
# Get PR context for better understanding
gh pr view --json title,body,head,base,labels

# Check related PRs and issues
gh pr list --search "involves:{conflicted_files}"

# Review commit context
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/compare/{base}...{head}
```

## Phase 2: Strategy-Specific Resolution Planning

### Safe Strategy Implementation
When \"safe\" is specified:
- Only auto-resolve obvious, non-functional conflicts
- Document all uncertain scenarios for manual review
- Preserve existing functionality at all costs
- Flag complex logic conflicts for team discussion

### Aggressive Strategy Implementation
When \"aggressive\" is specified:
- Make confident decisions based on code quality metrics
- Prioritize modern patterns and best practices
- Resolve all conflicts without external intervention
- Document reasoning for all non-trivial decisions

### Bias-Based Resolution
**Ours Preference:**
- Default to current branch when changes conflict
- Preserve existing architecture decisions
- Maintain current feature implementations
- Prioritize stability over new features

**Theirs Preference:**
- Accept incoming changes as primary
- Integrate new features and improvements
- Update to newer patterns and approaches
- Prioritize innovation over stability

## Phase 3: File-Type Specific Handling

### Package Management Files
Special handling for dependency files:

**package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml:**
```bash
# Delete and regenerate lock files
rm package-lock.json
npm install

# Or for yarn/pnpm
rm yarn.lock && yarn install
rm pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install
```

**Requirements files (Python):**
- Merge dependency lists intelligently
- Resolve version conflicts by choosing compatible versions
- Consider virtual environment implications

### Database and Schema Files
**Migration Files:**
- Never modify existing migrations
- Create new migrations for conflicting schema changes
- Ensure database consistency and rollback capability

**Schema Definitions:**
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Validate foreign key relationships
- Check for breaking changes in API contracts

### Configuration Files
**Environment Configurations:**
- Merge environment-specific settings
- Preserve security configurations
- Validate configuration schema compliance

**Build Configurations:**
- Combine build steps logically
- Ensure all environments are supported
- Validate build tool compatibility

## Phase 4: Systematic Conflict Resolution

### Conflict Identification and Prioritization
Use `read_file` to analyze each conflicted file:
1. **Critical System Files**: Core functionality, security, data integrity
2. **Business Logic**: Feature implementations, algorithms
3. **Configuration**: Settings, environment variables
4. **Dependencies**: Package files, imports
5. **Documentation**: README, comments, docs

### Resolution Execution
For each conflicted file, apply strategy-specific resolution:

```javascript
// Example: Aggressive strategy combining features
<<<<<<< HEAD
function authenticate(user) {
    return validateCredentials(user);
}
=======
function authenticate(user) {
    logAttempt(user);
    return validateCredentials(user);
}
>>>>>>> feature-branch

// Aggressive resolution: Combine both improvements
function authenticate(user) {
    logAttempt(user);
    return validateCredentials(user);
}
```

### Testing Integration (when specified)
If \"test\" is in arguments, run tests after each resolution:
```bash
# Run file-specific tests if available
npm test -- {resolved_file}

# Run full test suite for broader validation
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
```

## Phase 5: Validation and Quality Assurance

### Syntax and Semantic Validation
After each file resolution:
- Use `get_errors` to check for compilation errors
- Validate import/export statements
- Check for logical inconsistencies

### Strategy Compliance Verification
Ensure resolution follows specified strategy:
- **Safe**: No risky assumptions made
- **Aggressive**: All conflicts resolved decisively
- **Biased**: Preferences applied consistently
- **Targeted**: Only specified files modified

### Integration Testing
For critical files, run broader validation:
```bash
# Check application startup
npm start || python manage.py runserver

# Validate API endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/health

# Run smoke tests
npm run test:smoke
```

## Phase 6: Documentation and Reporting

### Resolution Decision Log
Document each significant resolution decision:

```markdown
# Conflict Resolution Report

## Strategy Applied
- **Approach**: {strategy_from_arguments}
- **Scope**: {files_or_global}
- **Bias**: {preference_applied}
- **Testing**: {test_integration_level}

## File Resolutions

### {file_path}
- **Conflict Type**: {content|structural|semantic}
- **Strategy Applied**: {specific_approach}
- **Decision Rationale**: {why_this_choice}
- **Risk Level**: {low|medium|high}
- **Test Result**: {pass|fail|not_applicable}

## Quality Metrics
- **Files Resolved**: {count}
- **Auto-Resolved**: {count}
- **Manual Decisions**: {count}
- **Tests Passing**: {percentage}
- **Warnings**: {list_any_concerns}

## Post-Resolution Recommendations
- {follow_up_actions}
- {areas_needing_review}
- {future_prevention_measures}
```

### Risk Assessment and Recommendations
Based on strategy and resolutions:
- Identify areas requiring additional testing
- Note potential integration issues
- Suggest code review focuses
- Recommend monitoring points

## Phase 7: Finalization and Next Steps

### Staging and Verification
Use `run_in_terminal` to finalize resolutions:
```bash
# Stage all resolved files
git add {resolved_files}

# Verify all conflicts are resolved
git status

# Final validation check
git diff --cached --check
```

### Strategy-Specific Next Steps
**Safe Strategy:**
- List unresolved conflicts requiring manual attention
- Provide detailed conflict analysis for team review
- Suggest pair programming sessions for complex resolutions

**Aggressive Strategy:**
- Proceed with commit creation
- Run comprehensive test suites
- Prepare detailed resolution documentation

**Testing-Integrated:**
- Ensure all tests pass before staging
- Generate test coverage reports
- Validate CI/CD pipeline compatibility

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Strategy-Specific Error Handling
**Safe Mode Failures:**
- Fall back to manual conflict marking
- Document specific failure points
- Provide detailed guidance for manual resolution

**Aggressive Mode Issues:**
- Implement rollback capabilities
- Create backup branches before resolution
- Validate decisions with broader test coverage

### Recovery Procedures
If resolution strategy fails:
```bash
# Create backup of current state
git stash push -m "backup-before-retry"

# Reset to pre-resolution state
git reset --hard HEAD

# Switch to alternative strategy
# Apply more conservative approach
```

## Success Criteria

Strategy-specific conflict resolution is complete when:
- [ ] All targeted conflicts are resolved according to strategy
- [ ] Strategy requirements are fully satisfied
- [ ] Testing integration (if specified) is successful
- [ ] File-type specific handling is properly applied
