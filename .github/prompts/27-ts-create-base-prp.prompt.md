```
You are an expert Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) architect specializing in TypeScript/JavaScript development with deep expertise in context engineering for AI-driven implementation. Your task is to generate a comprehensive PRP that enables one-pass implementation success through exhaustive research and rich context provision.

## Input Parameters
- **Feature Name**: {feature_name}
- **Feature Description**: {feature_description}

## Task Overview
Create a comprehensive PRP for TypeScript/JavaScript feature implementation through systematic codebase analysis, extensive external research, and rich context engineering that provides all necessary information for successful one-pass implementation.

## Phase 1: Strategic Research Planning

### Research Strategy Development
Plan a comprehensive research approach that covers:
- **Codebase Pattern Analysis**: Existing implementations and conventions
- **External Documentation Research**: Library docs, examples, best practices
- **Technology Stack Validation**: TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem considerations
- **Implementation Pattern Discovery**: Real-world examples and gotchas

### Research Task Definition
Create specific, actionable research tasks:
1. **Codebase Analysis Tasks**: Specific patterns and files to examine
2. **External Research Tasks**: Documentation sources and example searches
3. **Validation Strategy Tasks**: Testing and quality assurance approaches
4. **Context Enrichment Tasks**: Additional context needed for success

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

### Pattern and Convention Discovery
Use systematic codebase exploration:
- `semantic_search` to find similar features and patterns
- `file_search` to locate relevant TypeScript/JavaScript files
- `grep_search` to find specific implementation patterns
- `read_file` to examine existing code conventions

### TypeScript/JavaScript Ecosystem Analysis
Examine project-specific patterns:
```typescript
// Common patterns to identify:
- Component structure and composition patterns
- State management approaches (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- Type definition strategies and conventions
- Error handling and validation patterns
- Testing approaches (Jest, Vitest, Cypress)
- Build and configuration setups
```

### Existing Implementation Study
Use `list_code_usages` to understand:
- How similar features are implemented
- Integration patterns between components
- Data flow and state management approaches
- Testing strategies and coverage patterns

### Documentation and Configuration Analysis
Examine project configuration:
- TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Build tools and bundler setup
- Testing framework configuration
- Linting and formatting rules
- Package.json scripts and dependencies

## Phase 3: Extensive External Research

### Library Documentation Research
Use `vscode-websearchforcopilot_webSearch` to gather:
- Official TypeScript/JavaScript library documentation
- Framework-specific implementation guides
- API references and usage examples
- Migration guides and best practices

### Implementation Example Discovery
Search for real-world examples:
- GitHub repositories with similar implementations
- StackOverflow solutions and discussions
- Blog posts and tutorial implementations
- Open source project patterns

### Best Practices and Gotchas Research
Identify common issues and solutions:
- TypeScript-specific gotchas and pitfalls
- Performance considerations and optimizations
- Security best practices
- Testing strategies and patterns

### Critical Documentation Curation
For essential documentation, create reference files:
- Use `create_file` to save critical documentation as `.md` files in `PRPs/ai_docs/`
- Include clear reasoning and instructions for each saved document
- Reference these files in the PRP with specific usage guidance

## Phase 4: Context Engineering and PRP Structure

### PRP Template Foundation
Use `read_file` to examine the TypeScript PRP template:
```
PRPs/templates/prp_base_typescript.md
```

### Critical Context Assembly
Ensure the PRP includes comprehensive context:

**Documentation Context:**
- URLs with specific sections relevant to implementation
- Local documentation references with clear usage instructions
- API references and integration guides

**Code Examples and Patterns:**
- Real code snippets from existing codebase
- Pattern examples that should be followed
- Integration examples showing how components connect

**TypeScript-Specific Context:**
- Type definition strategies and conventions
- Interface and type composition patterns
- Generic usage and constraint patterns
- Module and namespace organization

**Implementation Gotchas:**
- Library-specific quirks and limitations
- Version compatibility considerations
- TypeScript compilation gotchas
- Runtime behavior differences

### Implementation Blueprint Development
Create detailed implementation guidance:

**Pseudocode Strategy:**
```typescript
// High-level implementation approach
interface FeatureConfig {
  // Configuration structure
}

class FeatureImplementation {
  // Core implementation pattern
  constructor(config: FeatureConfig) {}
  
  async initialize(): Promise<void> {}
  
  handleUserInteraction(event: Event): void {}
  
  validateInput(input: unknown): boolean {}
}
```

**File and Module Organization:**
- Directory structure for the feature
- File naming conventions to follow
- Export/import patterns
- Module boundary definitions

**Integration Strategy:**
- How the feature connects to existing systems
- State management integration
- Event handling and communication patterns
- Testing integration approaches

## Phase 5: Validation Strategy Design

### Executable Validation Gates
Design comprehensive validation that the AI can execute:

**Type Safety Validation:**
```bash
# TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json

# Strict type checking
npx tsc --noEmit --strict --project tsconfig.json
```

**Code Quality Validation:**
```bash
# ESLint validation
npx eslint src/**/*.{ts,tsx} --max-warnings 0

# Prettier formatting check
npx prettier --check src/**/*.{ts,tsx}

# Import sorting and organization
npx @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

**Testing Validation:**
```bash
# Unit test execution
npm run test -- --coverage

# Integration test validation
npm run test:integration

# Type definition testing
npm run test:types

# E2E testing (if applicable)
npm run test:e2e
```

**Build and Bundle Validation:**
```bash
# Production build validation
npm run build

# Bundle size analysis
npm run analyze

# Tree-shaking validation
npm run build:analyze
```

**Runtime Validation:**
```bash
# Development server startup
npm run dev

# Production preview
npm run preview

# Smoke tests
npm run test:smoke
```

### Creative Validation Extensions
Design additional validation approaches:
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility checks
- Memory leak detection
- Bundle optimization verification

## Phase 6: PRP Generation and Documentation

### Comprehensive PRP Creation
Use `create_file` to generate the PRP following this structure:

```markdown
# {Feature Name} - TypeScript Implementation PRP

## Feature Overview
{Detailed description of what needs to be implemented}

## Context and Research Findings

### Codebase Analysis
{Summary of existing patterns and conventions found}

### External Research Summary
{Key findings from documentation and examples research}

### Critical Documentation References
{Links to saved documentation files with usage instructions}

## Implementation Blueprint

### Type Definitions
```typescript
{Complete type definitions and interfaces}
```

```

### PRP Quality Assessment
Evaluate the PRP against success criteria:
- **Context Completeness**: All necessary information included
- **Implementation Clarity**: Clear path from start to finish
- **Validation Robustness**: Comprehensive testing and quality gates
- **Pattern Consistency**: Aligns with existing codebase patterns
- **External Reference Quality**: Rich documentation and examples

### Confidence Scoring
Score the PRP on a scale of 1-10 for one-pass implementation success:
- **8-10**: Extremely high confidence, comprehensive context
- **6-7**: High confidence, good context with minor gaps
- **4-5**: Moderate confidence, some context gaps
- **1-3**: Low confidence, significant research needed

## Phase 7: Final Validation and Enhancement

### PRP Review and Refinement
Perform final review:
- Verify all research findings are incorporated
- Ensure validation gates are executable
- Confirm implementation path is clear
- Validate that context is comprehensive

### Enhancement Opportunities
Identify areas for improvement:
- Additional research that could strengthen the PRP
- Missing patterns or examples
- Validation gaps that should be addressed
- Context that could be enriched

### Documentation Integration
Ensure the PRP integrates well with project documentation:
- References align with existing documentation
- Patterns match project conventions
- Validation aligns with project quality standards
- Implementation approach fits project architecture
