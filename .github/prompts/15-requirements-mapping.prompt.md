## Phase 1: Comprehensive Requirements Analysis

### Requirements Documentation Discovery and Analysis
Use `file_search` and `semantic_search` to identify and analyze all requirements sources:

```typescript
// Comprehensive requirements analysis framework
interface RequirementsAnalysisFramework {
  documentation_sources: {
    primary_requirements: Array<{
      document_path: string;
      document_type: 'functional' | 'technical' | 'business' | 'architectural';
      analysis_priority: 'critical' | 'important' | 'supporting';
      content_summary: string;
      key_insights: string[];
      requirement_count: number;
    }>;
    
    supporting_documentation: Array<{
      document_path: string;
      content_type: 'schema' | 'data' | 'configuration' | 'guidelines';
      relevance_score: number;
      integration_points: string[];
      technical_details: string[];
    }>;
    
    architectural_artifacts: Array<{
      artifact_path: string;
      artifact_type: 'diagram' | 'specification' | 'pattern' | 'example';
      architectural_insights: string[];
      implementation_guidance: string[];
    }>;
  };
  
  requirements_extraction: {
    functional_requirements: Array<{
      requirement_id: string;
      requirement_category: string;
      description: string;
      acceptance_criteria: string[];
      business_value: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
      implementation_complexity: 'simple' | 'medium' | 'complex';
      dependencies: string[];
      stakeholders: string[];
    }>;
    
    non_functional_requirements: Array<{
      requirement_id: string;
      category: 'performance' | 'security' | 'usability' | 'scalability' | 'reliability';
      description: string;
      measurable_criteria: string[];
      validation_methods: string[];
      implementation_considerations: string[];
    }>;
    
    technical_requirements: Array<{
      requirement_id: string;
      component: string;
      specification: string;
      technology_constraints: string[];
      integration_requirements: string[];
      quality_attributes: string[];
    }>;
  };
  
  business_context: {
    user_roles: Array<{
      role_name: string;
      role_description: string;
      key_responsibilities: string[];
      system_permissions: string[];
      user_journeys: string[];
      business_processes: string[];
    }>;
    
    business_workflows: Array<{
      workflow_name: string;
      workflow_description: string;
      process_steps: Array<{
        step_number: number;
        step_description: string;
        actor: string;
        system_interactions: string[];
        business_rules: string[];
      }>;
      success_criteria: string[];
      exception_handling: string[];
    }>;
    
    business_rules: Array<{
      rule_id: string;

      rule_description: string;
      enforcement_level: 'mandatory' | 'recommended' | 'optional';
      validation_approach: string[];
      implementation_impact: string[];
    }>;
  };
}

// Perform comprehensive requirements analysis
async function analyzeProjectRequirements(requirementsSource: string): Promise<RequirementsAnalysisFramework> {
  // Use file_search to discover all requirements-related files
  // Use semantic_search to understand requirement context and relationships
  // Use grep_search to extract specific requirement patterns and details
  // Analyze and categorize all discovered requirements
}
```

### Requirements Documentation Discovery
Use `file_search` to systematically discover requirements documentation:

```bash
# Comprehensive requirements discovery process
discover_requirements_documentation() {
    echo "üìã Discovering Project Requirements Documentation"
    
    # Primary requirements documentation
    echo "üîç Searching for primary requirements files..."
    find . -name "*requirements*" -type f | head -20
    find . -name "*features*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*specification*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*business*" -type f | head -10
    
    # Technical specifications
    echo "üîß Searching for technical specifications..."
    find . -name "*.sql" -path "*requirements*" -o -name "*.sql" -path "*schema*" | head -10
    find . -name "*.json" -path "*requirements*" -o -name "*.yaml" -path "*requirements*" | head -10
    
    # Architecture and design documentation
    echo "üèóÔ∏è Searching for architectural documentation..."
    find . -name "*architecture*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*design*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*guidelines*" -type f | head -10
    
    # Configuration and examples
    echo "‚öôÔ∏è Searching for configuration and examples..."
    find . -name "*config*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*example*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*template*" -type f | head -10
    
    # User and business documentation
    echo "üë• Searching for user and business documentation..."
    find . -name "*user*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*workflow*" -type f | head -10
    find . -name "*process*" -type f | head -10
}
```

### Detailed Requirements Extraction and Categorization
Use `read_file` and `grep_search` to extract specific requirements:

```bash
# Systematic requirements extraction process
extract_detailed_requirements() {
    echo "üìù Extracting and Categorizing Requirements"
    
    # Extract functional requirements
    echo "üéØ Extracting functional requirements..."
    grep -r -i "shall\|must\|should\|requirement\|feature" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" . | head -50
    
    # Extract user roles and permissions
    echo "üë§ Extracting user roles and permissions..."
    grep -r -i "role\|permission\|user\|access\|authorization" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" . | head -30
    
    # Extract business workflows
    echo "üîÑ Extracting business workflows..."
    grep -r -i "workflow\|process\|procedure\|step\|journey" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" . | head -30
    
    # Extract technical constraints
    echo "‚öôÔ∏è Extracting technical constraints..."
    grep -r -i "technology\|framework\|database\|api\|integration" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" . | head -30
    
    # Extract quality attributes
    echo "üìä Extracting quality attributes..."
    grep -r -i "performance\|security\|scalability\|usability\|reliability" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" . | head -30
}
```
