# Code Quality Command for GitHub Copilot

## Command Usage
```
@copilot /code-quality [action] [scope]
```

## Purpose
This command provides comprehensive code quality analysis and improvements for the Ikhtibar project, supporting C# backend and TypeScript/React frontend code. It follows project-specific patterns, SRP compliance, and architectural guidelines.

**Input Parameters**: 
- `action` - Code quality action: `refactor`, `review`, or `review-changes`
- `scope` - Analysis scope: `current`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `all`, specific file path, or folder path

## How /code-quality Works

### Phase 1: Action Selection and Context Analysis
```markdown
I'll help you with code quality improvements for the Ikhtibar project. Let me analyze your request and gather the necessary context.

**Phase 1.1: Parse Request Parameters**
```
Request Analysis:
- **Action**: [REFACTOR/REVIEW/REVIEW-CHANGES]
- **Scope**: [CURRENT/STAGED/UNSTAGED/ALL/FILE_PATH/FOLDER_PATH]
- **Project Type**: ASP.NET Core + React.js with TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Folder-per-feature with Clean Architecture principles
```

**Phase 1.2: Context Gathering using GitHub Copilot Tools**
```
I'll gather project context using GitHub Copilot's native tools:
- get_changed_files: [SCOPE_BASED_FILTER] # Get relevant changed files
- semantic_search: "code quality patterns" # Find existing quality patterns
- file_search: "**/*.cs" # Backend files (if applicable)
- file_search: "**/*.ts*" # Frontend files (if applicable)
- read_file: [RELEVANT_GUIDELINE_FILES] # Load project guidelines
- grep_search: "TODO|FIXME|HACK" # Find code quality issues
```

**Phase 1.3: Architecture and Pattern Analysis**
```
Project-Specific Analysis:
- [ ] **Tech Stack**: ASP.NET Core (.NET 8), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **Architecture Patterns**: Folder-per-feature, Clean Architecture, CQRS
- [ ] **Code Patterns**: Repository, Service Layer, Controller patterns
- [ ] **SRP Compliance**: Single Responsibility Principle enforcement
- [ ] **Testing Patterns**: Unit tests, integration tests, type safety
- [ ] **Security Patterns**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection
- [ ] **Performance Patterns**: Caching, lazy loading, bundle optimization
- [ ] **i18n Patterns**: i18next, RTL support, Arabic/English localization
```
```

### Phase 2: Action-Specific Analysis

#### For Action: `refactor`
```markdown
**Phase 2.1: Refactoring Analysis using GitHub Copilot Tools**

@copilot /code-quality [action] [scope]
```

The system should:
1. **Parse Parameters**: Extract action and scope parameters
2. **Gather Context**: Use GitHub Copilot tools for comprehensive analysis
3. **Execute Analysis**: Run action-specific analysis with tool integration
4. **Provide Recommendations**: Generate actionable improvement suggestions
5. **Support Implementation**: Provide guided implementation support (if refactoring)
6. **Validate Results**: Use tools to verify improvements and quality

## Notes
- The command adapts to Ikhtibar project-specific patterns and architectural guidelines
- All analysis uses GitHub Copilot's native tools for maximum accuracy
- SRP compliance is enforced throughout all recommendations
- Quality scoring follows project standards (minimum 8/10 for production)
- Security and performance considerations are integral to all assessments
- Internationalization (en/ar) and RTL support are considered in frontend analysis
- All recommendations include validation commands for user verification
