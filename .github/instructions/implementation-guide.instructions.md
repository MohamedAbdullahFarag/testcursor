# Ikhtibar Implementation Guide - Dependency-Ordered PRP Execution

## Overview
This guide provides the dependency-ordered implementation sequence for the Ikhtibar educational exam management system. Each PRP command has been renamed with a 2-digit prefix (01-21) to indicate the optimal implementation order based on feature dependencies.

## Implementation Strategy

### Why Dependency-Ordered Implementation?
1. **Minimizes Refactoring**: Each feature builds on previously implemented foundations
2. **Reduces Integration Issues**: Dependencies are available when needed
3. **Enables Incremental Testing**: Each layer can be tested as it's completed
4. **Supports Agile Development**: Working software at each milestone

## Support and Resources

### Development Team Coordination
- Daily standups to track progress against numbered sequence
- Weekly layer completion reviews
- Immediate escalation for any dependency issues

### Documentation
- Each PRP execution creates implementation documentation
