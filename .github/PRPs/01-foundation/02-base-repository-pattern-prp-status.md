## Implementation Status by Task

### Define IRepository Interface
| Task | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Create IRepository.cs with required methods | ✅ Complete | `Ikhtibar.Core/Repositories/Interfaces/IRepository.cs` | Interface fully implemented with all required methods and additional ones like GetPagedAsync, CountAsync, HardDeleteAsync |
| Avoid business logic in interface | ✅ Complete | Interface only contains data access method definitions | Properly follows SRP with no business logic |

### Implement BaseRepository Class
| Task | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Inject IDbConnectionFactory | ✅ Complete | `BaseRepository<T>` constructor injects IDbConnectionFactory | Proper dependency injection pattern followed |
| Implement async methods with Dapper | ✅ Complete | All methods use async Dapper calls (QueryAsync, ExecuteAsync) | Properly follows async patterns |
| Apply soft-delete filters | ✅ Complete | Where clauses include `IsDeleted = 0` filtering | Soft-delete pattern correctly implemented |
| Use parameterized queries | ✅ Complete | All SQL operations use parameterized queries | SQL injection protection in place |
| Avoid generic exception handling | ✅ Complete | No improper exception handling patterns found | Follows recommended error handling |

### Create Connection Factory
| Task | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Implement factory pattern | ✅ Complete | `IDbConnectionFactory.cs` & `DbConnectionFactory.cs` | Properly implements factory pattern |
| Support SQL Server connections | ✅ Complete | Uses Microsoft.Data.SqlClient | SQL Server connection setup correctly |

### Register in DI Container
| Task | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Register required services | ✅ Complete | Services registered in Program.cs | Both IDbConnectionFactory and IRepository<> registered |
| Use generic registration | ✅ Complete | Uses typeof(IRepository<>), typeof(BaseRepository<>) | Properly registers generic repository |

### Write Unit Tests
| Task | Status | ❌ Missing | No test files found | No evidence of repository unit tests |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Use in-memory SQLite or test containers | ❌ Missing | No test implementation found | No test setup for repositories |
| Test CRUD operations | ❌ Missing | No test implementation found | No tests for repository operations |

## Implementation Gaps

### Missing Unit Tests
No unit tests were found for the BaseRepository implementation. The PRP specifically requires:
- Tests using in-memory SQLite or test containers
- Tests for CRUD operations and filter behavior
- Tests following the AAA pattern

## Test Coverage
- **Current Test Coverage**: 0% for repository code
- **Required Test Coverage**: >80% according to quality gates
- **Gap**: Significant testing gap exists for the repository implementation

## Recommendations
1. **Implement unit tests for BaseRepository**: Create comprehensive tests for all CRUD operations
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: Medium
   - Setup in-memory SQLite database for testing or use Docker test containers
   - Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern as specified in PRP

2. **Add test coverage analysis**: Configure code coverage tools in the CI pipeline
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: Low
   - Ensure >80% coverage for repository code as specified in the quality gates

## Next Steps
1. Create `BaseRepositoryTests.cs` in the test project with proper test infrastructure
2. Implement tests for all CRUD operations (GetByIdAsync, GetAllAsync, AddAsync, UpdateAsync, DeleteAsync)
3. Test edge cases like handling of soft deletes, invalid IDs, etc.
4. Set up code coverage analysis to verify the 80% coverage requirement
