- Aligned return types with appropriate DTOs
- Added proper null checking and validation

## Architecture Decisions Made
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns (Repository â†’ Service â†’ Controller)
- âœ… Comprehensive DTO layer for data transfer
- âœ… Tree operations using materialized path + closure table pattern
- âœ… Proper validation and error handling
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and audit trails

## Phase Status
### Phase 1: Context Discovery & Analysis âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Started**: 2025-01-24T16:15:00Z
- **Completed**: 2025-01-24T16:16:00Z

#### Context Analysis Results:
- **Feature Scope**: Comprehensive hierarchical tree management system for question bank module
- **Phases**: 4 identified (Foundation, Core Features, Advanced Features, Integration)
- **Tasks**: 78 total implementation tasks
- **Dependencies**: Existing TreeNode system, Question entities, User management
- **Quality Gates**: 10 validation points
- **Success Criteria**: Performance (<2s tree load), Security (RBAC), Integration (seamless)

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Started**: 2025-01-24T16:16:00Z
- **Completed**: 2025-07-24T12:00:00Z

## Issues & Resolutions
- Incorrect IDbConnectionFactory usage in QuestionBankCategoryRepository; replaced async connection call with synchronous `CreateConnection()` and rewrote repository implementation.
- Ambiguous type references in QuestionBankTreeService fixed by adding explicit namespace qualifications for DTO types.
- Ambiguous references in FirebasePushProvider fixed with namespace aliases for PushPlatform and Notification types.
- Interface inconsistency in service implementations resolved with standardized method signatures and return types.
- Controller scaffolding implemented with proper route attributes and authorization policies.
