## Implementation Approach
The media management system will be implemented following the established patterns in the Ikhtibar platform:

1. **Storage Strategy**: 
   - Azure Blob Storage for cloud deployments
   - Local file storage for development environments
   - Configurable provider model for easy switching

2. **Media Processing Pipeline**:
   - Background services for media optimization and thumbnail generation
   - Queue-based architecture for handling large files
   - Scalable processing model with status tracking

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - File type validation and virus scanning integration
   - Access control based on user roles and permissions
   - Secure URL generation for time-limited access

## Architecture Decisions Made
- ‚úÖ Storage Provider Strategy: Azure Blob Storage with local fallback for development
- ‚úÖ Media Processing Approach: Background services with queue-based processing
