## React Key Prop Warning - Issue and Solution

### Issue Description
Console warning: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop" occurring in the `S23` component from mada-design-system library during footer rendering.

### Root Cause
The warning originates from within the `mada-design-system` library's Footer component (`S23` internal component), specifically when rendering lists of links, social media icons, or group links.

### Stack Trace Location
```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of `S23`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at S23 (mada-design-system.js:48463:21)
    at PortalFooter (PortalFooter.tsx:26:24)
```

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. **Optimized PortalFooter Component** ✅
- Separated arrays into individual `useMemo` hooks for better stability
- Ensured all inner React elements have proper keys
- Minimized re-renders with stable references

#### 2. **Warning Suppression** ✅  
- Created targeted console.warn override for development
- Suppresses only specific mada-design-system warnings
- Preserves other important React warnings

#### 3. **Component Structure Improvements**
- Removed unnecessary wrapper div
- Applied key directly to Footer component
- Improved memoization strategy

### Files Modified
```
frontend/src/layout/PortalLayout/PortalFooter.tsx - Optimized structure
frontend/src/utils/suppressWarnings.ts - Warning suppression utility  
frontend/src/main.tsx - Import warning suppression
```

### Recommendations

#### Short-term
- ✅ Warning suppression active for development
- ✅ Component optimized for performance

#### Long-term  
- Monitor mada-design-system updates for internal fixes
- Consider contributing fix to library if issue persists
- Document any library-specific workarounds

### Testing
- Verify warning no longer appears in console
- Confirm footer functionality remains intact
- Check performance impact is minimal

### Notes
This is a library-internal issue that doesn't affect functionality but creates console noise. The suppression is targeted and temporary until the upstream library addresses the issue.
