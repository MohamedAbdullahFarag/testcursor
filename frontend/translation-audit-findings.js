// Missing Translation Keys Analysis and Solutions

/* 
MAJOR FINDINGS:
1. Content Management module has very limited translations and is mostly hardcoded
2. Category pages (System, Analytics, Customer Experience, Help) are completely hardcoded
3. Several components use translations but the keys may be missing from locale files
4. Some modules have JSON locale files, others have TypeScript files - inconsistent structure

MODULES WITH MISSING TRANSLATIONS:

1. Content Management Module:
   - Current: Very basic locale file with just title and validation
   - Missing: All the feature descriptions, stats, breadcrumbs, etc.

2. Category Pages:
   - SystemCategoryPage.tsx: No translations at all
   - AnalyticsCategoryPage.tsx: No translations at all  
   - CustomerExperienceCategoryPage.tsx: No translations at all
   - HelpCategoryPage.tsx: No translations at all

3. Dashboard Module:
   - May have missing keys for new features

4. Shared Components:
   - PageHeader, Breadcrumbs, MainPanel may need translation support

IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
1. Update Content Management locale files
2. Add translation support to all category pages
3. Create shared locale file for common UI elements
4. Ensure all hardcoded strings use translation functions
