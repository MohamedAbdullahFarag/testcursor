# Frontend Development Guidelines

## When creating frontend code:
1. Reference existing patterns from `frontend/src/modules/`
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data
3. Implement proper loading and error states
4. Use translation keys (i18n) for all text
5. Follow established component patterns with memoization
6. Support accessibility requirements

## Component Structure
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Include loading and error states
- Support RTL/LTR layouts
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props

## State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- Use React Query for server state
- Follow established store patterns

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS with consistent patterns
- Support both Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) layouts
- Follow established design system

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't create components without TypeScript typing
- Don't forget loading and error states
- Don't hardcode text strings
- Don't skip established API client patterns
- Don't ignore accessibility requirements

## Validation Commands
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
```
